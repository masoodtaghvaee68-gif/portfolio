## 👋 About Me

I am transitioning into IT / Cloud with a strong focus on **automation, system thinking, and AI-assisted workflows**.

I build practical, real-world projects that solve concrete problems — not demos — and help me deeply understand how modern IT, Cloud, and automation systems work together.

My current focus is:
- Workflow automation (n8n)
- AI-assisted analysis & decision support
- End-to-end system design using real inputs (emails, APIs, messaging platforms)

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🧠 AI Job Agent  
**Email → AI Analysis → Telegram**

An AI-powered automation that analyzes job-related emails (LinkedIn, StepStone, recruiters), extracts key information, explains requirements, and delivers structured insights directly to Telegram.

#### What it does
- Reads job-related emails automatically
- Extracts key facts (role, company, location, seniority)
- Translates content into Persian (bilingual output)
- Expands technical & HR abbreviations (IT / Cloud)
- Analyzes required skills and missing gaps
- Suggests interview preparation points
- Recommends whether to apply or not
- Delivers results to Telegram (auto-split for message limits)

#### Why this project matters
This project reflects how I:
- Think in systems, not isolated tools
- Automate repetitive analysis intelligently
- Use AI as a **decision-support assistant**, not a black box
- Design end-to-end workflows with real constraints
